The "run_analysis" script computes "data" and "tidydata" data sets from the the training and test data sets.

The "data" data set gets the column names from file from features.txt and converst them in the following was:
- "t" is replaced by "time"
- "f" is replaced by "frequency"
- "gyro" is replaced with "-gyroscope"
- "acc" is replaced with "accelerometer"
- "std" is replaced with "standarddeviation"
- "Mag" is repositioned at the end of the string
- "()" are omitted
- names with "jerk" are replaced with "yes", names without "jerk" are replaced with "no"
- "bodybody" is replaced with "body"

The names are fromated into categories: "domain","acceleration","device","derived","type","coordinate", sepparated with "-". 
For example, columnname "time-body-accelerometer-no-mean-x" correspond to domain=time, acceleration=body, device=accelerometer
derrived=no, type=mean, coordinate=x. The values from this columns are unalterd from the original files and normalized and 
bounded within [-1,1]. Additionaly it contains columns "activity", corresponding to the activity label from files "y_train.txt"
and "y_test.txt" masekd with the values from "activity_labels.txt", and "subject" corresponding to file "subject_train.txt".

The "tidydata" data set contains columns "activity", "subject", "domain","acceleration","device","derived","type","coordinate" 
and "value". Columns "activity", "subject", "domain","acceleration","device","derived","type","coordinate" are derived from "data"
column names. The "value" correspond to the mean of the values from "data" with same "activity", "subject", "domain","acceleration",
"device","derived","type","coordinate" values.
